 # OOP Assignment

## Activity 1: Design Your Own Class 🏗️
- Base class: `Smartphone`
- Derived class: `SmartphoneGaming`
- Uses constructors, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Methods:
  - `show_info()`
  - `charge_battery()`

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge 🎭
- Classes: `Vehicle` (base), `Car`, `Plane`
- Each class implements `move()` differently
- Demonstrates polymorphism in action
